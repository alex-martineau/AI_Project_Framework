# AI Project Framework

A generic framework for structuring AI and data science projects.
This repository includes a standard organization for managing data, notebooks, models, and documentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a reusable foundation for any machine learning project
- Facilitate collaboration (code, notebooks, reports)
- Implement best practices (testing, modularity, separation of data and code)

## 📂 Structure
- `data/`: raw, processed, and external data
- `notebooks/`: exploration and modeling notebooks
- `src/`: modular Python code (preprocessing, features, models, visualization)
- `scripts/`: main execution pipeline
- `tests/`: unit tests
- `reports/`: generated reports and figures
- `docs/`: project documentation

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-martineau/AI_Project_Framework.git
cd AI_Project_Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
